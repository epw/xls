This program uses Tcl/Tk to create a window listing a directory
graphically. It lays the files out vertically, as the standard ls
program does, but directory contents are listed horizontally after the
name. Further subdirectories continue to alternate the direction.

For example, if a directory contains the files "a", "b", and "c", as
well as the subdirectories "dir_d/" and "dir_e/", and dir_d contains
the files f and g, the display will roughly appear as:

|---------------|
| a             |
| b             |
| c             |
| dir_d/   f  g |
| dir_e/        |
|---------------|

xls has one optional argument, the directory to list. If omitted, it
will list the current directory.

xls should run as long as a recent version of Tk is installed on the
system. At the time of writing, Tk 8.5 was used.

To install, run
   $ chmod +x xls.tcl
and copy xls.tcl to a bin/ directory such as $HOME/bin or
/usr/local/bin . It can then be executed with
   $ xls.tcl
